# Notes on Modern Application Development: Accessibility and Aesthetics

## Importance of Accessibility
- **Awareness of Disabilities**: It's crucial to consider that the majority of web applications are designed with the assumption of users having normal sensory abilities (vision, hearing, motor functions).
- **Types of Impairments**:
  - **Visual Impairment**: Ranges from complete blindness to low vision (e.g. poor contrast, small font sizes).
  - **Speech Impairments**: Users may struggle with voice interaction or understanding speech output.
  - **Motor Disabilities**: Challenges in using touch interfaces or needing assistive technology for navigation.

## Key Questions on Accessibility
1. Can the designed page/application be accessed by individuals with disabilities?
2. What barriers exist that prevent comprehension of the content?
3. How can accessibility be enhanced?

## W3C Recommendations
- **W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)**: Governing body providing recommendations rather than strict rules, particularly for web accessibility.
- They offer accessibility guidelines that are beneficial for designing inclusive websites and applications.

## Core Principles of Accessibility (WCAG)
1. **Perceivable**:
   - Provide text alternatives for non-text content (images, videos, etc.).
   - Create content that can be presented in various forms.
   - Ensure content is easy to see and hear.

2. **Operable**:
   - Ensure all functionality is available from a keyboard.
   - Provide sufficient time for users to read and react to content.
   - Avoid content that can trigger photosensitivity.
   - Make navigation and content discovery straightforward.

3. **Understandable**:
   - Make text readable and in clear language.
   - Content should behave in predictable ways.
   - Provide clear inputs to minimize user errors.

4. **Robust**:
   - Adhere to standards to ensure compatibility across different tools and browsers.

## Techniques for Accessibility
- Use descriptive labels for user interface elements.
- Employ HTML tags to support assistive technologies.
- Evaluate website accessibility using available tools.

## Aesthetics in Application Design
- Visual appearance influences user experience and acceptance of applications.
- Evolution of design elements (e.g. Apple iPhone icons).
- Simplicity in design is becoming more prevalent, moving away from complex aesthetics.
- Aesthetic standards and preferences evolve over time, making it essential to stay updated.

## Summary
- A view can be any output seen by users or machines.
- Prioritize accessibility in design to cater to a broader audience.
- Aesthetics enhance the user interface but should not come at the expense of accessibility.
- Utilizing tools for automatic generation and consistent layouts is crucial for effective view design in large applications.
- Always learn from industry standards and experiences to inform application development.

This concludes the summary of key points regarding accessibility and aesthetics in modern application development.
